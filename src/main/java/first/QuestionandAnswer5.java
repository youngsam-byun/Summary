    /**
     *
     * I will give you 2 examples
     * one if for good approach I think technically
     * business- wise good approach
     *
     *
     * 1. technicall approach
     * we launch android application for the salesman in APAC region
     * to key in their sales performance on a daily basis
     * when group of users did the UAT in our staing environment
     * everything was working fine
     * but on GO-LIVE date, it was not working
     * particularirly, those gorup of user belong to specific telco
     * only this people in SIngapore was not working
     *
     * I was summoned by upper management to take a look,
     * 1. I talked to developer
     * 2. second I scanned the code quickly
     * then I couldlnt find anything weired
     *
     * this is the part where I apply my technical knowlege
     * client, and server side in production evnrionment
     * I installed the packet capture tool
     * and capture the packet
     *
     * I discovered in HTTP header,
     * I found user tefild valued was changed back to generic one
     * e.g: samsung MCS 2.0 -> gzip/compress
     *
     * I did a screentshot sent it to telco
     * 1 working day later, they golt back to me
     * to test again, Although they didn't admit this sort of bug?
     * now it was working fine
     *
     *
     * for businness approaceh
     * recently we published redemtpin for customers
     * which is samsung-redemtpoion,.com
     *
     * and indonesia user want to add another features
     * which is eVouchter type of redemptino for their telco partner
     *
     * where as australia wants  to
     *similiar but airline partenr miliage
     *
     * so after I spoke to both parties,
     * I realize I can make a generic feature
     * and I can propose to Key stake holders in RHQ
     *
     * I seekded for them epxlain
     * that this si better
     * 1/ because you can save your cost
     * 2. we can also iron out , standardize the process
     * 3. on our end,
     *    we don't have to do similar work 2 times
     *
     *
     *
     * */
