     *
     * 1. from client side
     *  1) use crhome browser than IE
     *  2) they can subscribe high speed internet
     *  3) browser can use caching
     *
     * 2. server side
     *  1) for the front part
     *     you can use different domain for different type of sources
     *     because concurrent request to specific destination has a limit
     *     for instance 5 per domain
     *     you can put stylesheet to cs.google.com
     *     you can put js         to js.google.com
     *     you can put            to apps.google.com/yourapp
     *
     *  2) use server side caching using memeory sharing server
     *  3) use compression technologoy
     *     when you return the result of request
     *     you can compress before you send it back to client
     *
     *  4) application optimization
     *  5) JVM tuning
